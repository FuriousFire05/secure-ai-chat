# 🧠 Secure AI Chat  
### Privacy-Preserving AI Assistant with PII Detection & Redaction  

A full-stack **Flask + React** app that detects and redacts sensitive data (PII) from images before sending them to an AI model.  
Built for hackathons and real-world privacy use-cases — your data is scrubbed **before** it reaches AI systems.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🧩 **Text & Image Chat:** Talk to the AI or send screenshots/documents.  
- 🔍 **Automatic PII Detection (OCR + Regex):** Detects emails, phone numbers, and names.  
- 🕵️ **Selective Redaction:** Choose what to hide before sending.  
- 🧾 **Simulated AI Mode:** Works offline / without an API key (auto-switches when real key added).  
- 💬 **Local Chat History:** Stored safely in your browser.  
- 📤 **Export Chat:** One-click export as `.md`.  
- 🧰 **Clean UI:** Fast, minimal React interface with banners and loading states.

## 🧱 Tech Stack  

| Layer | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| **Frontend** | React + Vite + Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | Flask (Python), Pillow, pytesseract |
| **AI Integration** | OpenAI GPT-4o (auto-fallback to simulation) |
| **OCR Engine** | Tesseract-OCR |
| **Environment** | Conda (Python) + npm (Node) |

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/secure-ai-chat.git
cd secure-ai-chat
```

### 2️⃣ Backend (Flask) 
```bash
cd server
conda create -n secure-ai-chat-backend python=3.11 -y
conda activate secure-ai-chat-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Install Tesseract OCR (Windows)

1. Download → https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki 
2. Confirm this path exists:
```bash
C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
```
3. If installed elsewhere, update in server/main.py: 
```bash
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"<your-tesseract-path>"
``` 

### 4️⃣ Environment Variables

Create server/.env:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-real-key-here
``` 
Leave blank → runs in simulated mode until real key available.

### 5️⃣ Run Backend
```bash
python main.py
``` 
Flask runs at 👉 http://127.0.0.1:8000

### 6️⃣ Frontend (React)
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Vite runs at 👉 http://localhost:5173

## 💻 How It Works

1. Upload an image with text (e.g., ID card / document / screenshot).
2.Backend extracts text using Tesseract OCR.
3. Regex detects emails, phones, names, etc.
4. You select which items to redact.
5. Redacted image (black boxes) is generated locally.
6. Sent to AI (simulated until real key available).
7. AI replies while keeping your data private.

## 🎥 1-Minute Demo Script

- 👤 **You:** “This is Secure AI Chat, a privacy-first assistant that detects and redacts sensitive info before processing.”
- 1️⃣ Upload an image → see detected PII on the right.
- 2️⃣ Select items → click **Redact & Send.**
- 3️⃣ Show the black-boxed redacted preview.
- 4️⃣ Explain: “This ensures no private data ever reaches the AI.”
- 5️⃣ Send a text → see simulated AI reply.

#### 🎯 **Wrap up:**

“When the official API key is added, the same workflow runs with GPT-4o — keeping privacy fully intact.”
